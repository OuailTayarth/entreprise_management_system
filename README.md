# Enterprise HR Management Dashboard

A full-stack HR dashboard to manage employees, teams and departments, role-based access, and analytics charts.

I built it as a deep-dive learning project to strengthen my skills with **AWS web services** (EC2, RDS, API Gateway, Amplify, S3, Cognito), **PostgreSQL + Prisma**, **Redux Toolkit**, and in designing a **scalable end-to-end** web application on AWS.
